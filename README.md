# Password Generator

This project is a Java Console Application that can be used to generate a new password and rate the strength of a provided password.

## Inspiration

As an effort to learn more about object-oriented programming, I've decided to create a password generator console app. Through some recommendations and scouring the internet for suggestions, it seemed like creating a password generator would be a neat place to start. Password creation is a very critical part of pretty much every application we use today, so understanding some of the basic concepts behind what makes these applications run the way they do seemed interesting to me. As a start to what I hope to soon create into a more polished and refined web version, this application runs solely through the console.

## Components

This project currently supports:

- Generating a password.
- Rating the strength of a password.
- Supporting useful tips on password creation.
